# Custom ETH Address Generator ⚡

Generate **custom Ethereum addresses** at extreme speeds using modern NVIDIA RTX GPUs.  
This project is **inspired by 1inch/profanity2**, but rebuilt and heavily accelerated for **next-gen RTX architectures** — including **RTX 4090 / 5090**.

Use this tool to mine **vanity Ethereum addresses** such as:
```
0x0000...
0xDEAD...
0xCAFE...
0xSOL...
0xBABE...
```

Perfect for **branding**, **security**, or simply having a unique, recognizable wallet.

## 🚀 Try It Instantly With Our Own RTX 5090

You can test the generator live:

👉 **https://customethaddress.com**

The backend runs on a dedicated **RTX 5090**, giving you *real-world GPU benchmarks* and instant results for short prefixes.

---

## 🔥 Features

- ⚡ **GPU-accelerated prefix search** (optimized for RTX 4090 & 5090)
- 🔐 Full client-side private key generation for maximum security
- 🧩 Supports prefix + suffix patterns
- 🌐 Web UI for instant vanity address creation
- 🚀 Ethereum-compatible (secp256k1)

## 🧠 Why This Exists

Most vanity generators are either:

- **CPU-only** → slow  
- **Browser-limited** → depends on user hardware  
- **Unoptimized** → not adapted for modern GPUs  

This project solves that with:

- Custom GPU kernels  
- Heavy RTX optimization  
- Secure ephemeral key handling  
- A simple, fast web interface  

Inspired by **profanity2**, but rewritten for **high-end GPU acceleration**.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Enter a prefix (e.g., `0x0000`, `0xBABE`, `0xALPHA`)
2. GPU brute-forces billions of keys per second
3. When a match is found, you instantly receive:
   - Public address  
   - Private key (generated locally)
4. You save it securely (never uploaded)

**Everything is generated runtime only — nothing is stored.**

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

| Hardware     | 4-char Prefix | 5-char Prefix | 6-char Prefix |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| CPU (Browser) | very slow      | impractical     | impossible     |
| RTX 3090     | fast           | decent          | slow           |
| RTX 4090     | extremely fast | fast            | manageable     |
| **RTX 5090** | **ultra-fast** | **very fast**   | **realistic**  |

GPU mode is **hundreds of times faster** than browser CPU mode.
